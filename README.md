Project for my final in my algorithms class

This is the work of people working on world bank data for our algorithms for decision making class

By Roo, Obinna, Keen, Tariro

Two problems in data sets:

(1) Some "Country Name" is not actually a country (ie: Labeled as ("Low Income","High Income","Heavily indebted poor countries")) How should we go about this?
(2) Educational Data is lacking... There's alot of gaps, how should we deal with the NA's? 
(3) Should we just choose a couple of countries to look at? say 5 countries in each continent? That has data? Really difficult to measure without it -- unless we add some type of model that will account for this lack of data -- (that's probably a lot of work)
